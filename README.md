## How to Run ##
<p>
The navigation bar has 3 elements to navigate to other pages which include projects and their repositories and their sites.<br>
In this project bootsrap styling is used with other defined styling included in style.css file.
</p>
Bootstrap CSS and JS are used using the following CDN links references without the need for downloading the files and include them in the project files. 
<p>
[Bootstrap CSS ]

     ( href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
      )
<p/>

  [Bootstrap JS and popper, the order in wich the bootstrap javascript are called is:  Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS]
  
    <script
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.6/dist/umd/popper.min.js"
      integrity="sha384-oBqDVmMz9ATKxIep9tiCxS/Z9fNfEXiDAYTujMAeBAsjFuCZSmKbSSUnQlmh/jp3"
